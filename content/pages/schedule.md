Title: Schedule
author: Benoit Dherin 
slug: schedule

The class will be divided into two parts, the midterm being the divider. 
Before the miterm, we will focus on learning the basis of programming 
with Python. The second part of the class will focus more on data analysis, and 
we will learn R. The second part will start with a crash course on programming with
R, assuming that the basics of programming (statements, scripts, functions, algorithms,
branching, looping, classes, libraries, etc.) have been assimilated withing the first
part of the class.

For both parts, the material covered during class time will be reccorded using the 
[iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 
You will find below links to the class iPython notebooks along with the class 
textbooks, on which we will draw upon.
